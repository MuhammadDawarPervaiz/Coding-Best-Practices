## General Guidelines

1. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Format your SQL code consistently to improve readability and maintainability. Use uppercase for SQL keywords and consistent indentation.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table
   WHERE condition
   ORDER BY column1;

   -- Bad
   select column1,column2 from table where condition order by column1;
   ```

2. **Be Explicit with Column Names**: Always specify the column names in your `SELECT` statements rather than using `*`. This improves performance and clarity.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   SELECT id, name, email
   FROM users;

   -- Bad
   SELECT *
   FROM users;
   ```

3. **Use Aliases Wisely**: Use table and column aliases to make your queries easier to read, especially in complex queries.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   SELECT u.name, o.order_date
   FROM users AS u
   JOIN orders AS o ON u.id = o.user_id;

   -- Bad
   SELECT users.name, orders.order_date
   FROM users
   JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
   ```

## Query Writing

1. **Use `JOIN` Appropriately**: Prefer `JOIN` clauses over subqueries for better performance and readability. Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` as appropriate.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   SELECT u.name, o.order_date
   FROM users u
   LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

   -- Bad
   SELECT name, order_date
   FROM users, orders
   WHERE users.id = orders.user_id(+);
   ```

2. **Optimize `WHERE` Clauses**: Use `WHERE` clauses to filter data as early as possible to reduce the number of rows processed.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   SELECT name, email
   FROM users
   WHERE status = 'active';

   -- Bad
   SELECT name, email
   FROM users;
   ```

3. **Avoid Complex `SELECT` Statements**: Break down complex `SELECT` statements into simpler, modular queries or use common table expressions (CTEs) to improve readability.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   WITH recent_orders AS (
       SELECT user_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY user_id
   )
   SELECT u.name, r.last_order_date
   FROM users u
   JOIN recent_orders r ON u.id = r.user_id;

   -- Bad
   SELECT u.name, (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders WHERE user_id = u.id) AS last_order_date
   FROM users u;
   ```

## Performance Optimization

1. **Indexing**: Use indexes to speed up search queries, but avoid over-indexing as it can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

   -- Bad
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email, name, created_at);
   ```

2. **Analyze and Optimize Queries**: Regularly analyze your queries using the `EXPLAIN` statement or database-specific performance tools to identify and resolve performance issues.

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT name, email
   FROM users
   WHERE status = 'active';
   ```

3. **Use Efficient Data Types**: Choose the appropriate data types for your columns to save space and improve query performance.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       email VARCHAR(255),
       created_at TIMESTAMP
   );

   -- Bad
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT,
       email TEXT,
       created_at DATE
   );
   ```

## Database Design

1. **Normalize Your Database**: Follow normalization principles to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Ensure your database schema is properly normalized up to an appropriate level (usually 3NF).

2. **Use Foreign Keys**: Define foreign keys to enforce referential integrity between related tables.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT,
       order_date DATE,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
   );

   -- Bad
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT,
       order_date DATE
   );
   ```

3. **Plan for Scalability**: Design your schema with future growth in mind. Consider partitioning tables and optimizing for both read and write performance.

## Security

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?;

   -- Bad
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```

2. **Limit User Privileges**: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to database users to limit the impact of potential security breaches.

   ```sql
   -- Good
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database_name.* TO 'user'@'host';

   -- Bad
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'user'@'host';
   ```

3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.

## Testing and Maintenance

1. **Test Your Queries**: Always test your queries in a development environment before deploying them to production to ensure they perform as expected.

2. **Perform Regular Backups**: Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss in case of failures or corruption.

3. **Monitor and Maintain**: Continuously monitor database performance and conduct routine maintenance tasks such as vacuuming, indexing, and analyzing.

## Documentation

1. **Document Your Schema**: Keep detailed documentation of your database schema, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.

2. **Comment Your SQL Code**: Use comments to explain complex queries, especially if they involve multiple joins or subqueries.

   ```sql
   -- Get the most recent order date for each user
   WITH recent_orders AS (
       SELECT user_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY user_id
   )
   SELECT u.name, r.last_order_date
   FROM users u
   JOIN recent_orders r ON u.id = r.user_id;
   ```
